oEmbed
  - What is it?
    - a specification for getting an embedable version of a URL

  - What is it for?
    - embedding videos, photos, text from 3rd party sites

  - How does it work?
    - Pass url parameter to oembed endpoint
    - Pass maxwidth/maxheight options to specify size
    - Response has info about the URL (type, size, title, html)

  - Who supports it?
    - YouTube, Flickr, Vimeo, others

  - What is wrong with it?
    - Supporting each site separately means dealing with each site's bugs
    - Don't always provide HTML, so you have to handle each "type" and generate HTML
    - Better to wrap all the services and correct any issues in each

Noembed
  - What is it?
    - A single oEmbed endpoint that supports a number of 3rd party sites
    - Acts as an oEmbed proxy, but normalizes responses
    - All responses include HTML, so it is very easy to use
    - Includes sites that don't natively support oembed (e.g. Wikipedia)

  - Prior art?
    - Embed.ly (not free, not extendable)
    - Oohembed (no longer exists)

  - Who is using it?
    - MetroTwit
    - StatusNet
    - Alice (web IRC)
    - Ars Technica

  - Show demo page

  - How does it work?

    - Providers define a list of URL patterns they support (optionally shorturls)
    - If a provider matches the content is downloaded and passed to the provider for processing
